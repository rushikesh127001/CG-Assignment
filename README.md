# Kruskals-Algorithm
A visual demonstration of Kruskal's algorithm created in C++ and rendered in openGL via SFML.
This is a simple graphically rendered program that utilizes SFML to render Kruskal's Mininmum Spanning Tree algorithm step by step.

The controls are as below:

Left click creates a node in the graph.

Using Right click on two seperate nodes links them togeather.

The Space bar begins execution of the algorithm sequentially demonstrating the formation of the minimum spanning tree.
